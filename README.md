## üìú How to Play

### üõ†Ô∏è Game Setup & Core Mechanics

1. **Select Number of Players**: Choose between 2, 3, or 4 players.
2. **Initial Placement**: At the start of the game, each player selects a designated "box" on the game board. The initial circle placed in this box will begin with 3 "power" (pow).
3. **Adding Power**: On your turn, you can only add power to your own circles. Click on one of your circles to add 1 power to it.
4. **Circle Division**: When a circle accumulates 4 power, it divides into 4 new circles, each with 1 power. The original box from which the division occurred will become empty.
5. **Circle Conversion**: If a player's circle is hit by an opponent's circle, it converts to the opponent's color. If the converted circle has 3 power, it immediately divides according to the opponent's circle division logic.
6. **Sequential Division**: A sequential division mechanism is implemented. After an initial circle divides, any adjacent circles that subsequently reach 4 power will divide in a cascading sequence.

### üèÜ Winning

- A player is eliminated when they have no circles left on the board.
- The last player with circles on the board wins the game.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface & Experience

- **Turn Indicator**: The current player's turn is clearly displayed.
- **Winner Display**: The winner is displayed at the end of the game.
- **Theme Toggle**: A theme toggle is available to switch between a green theme and a dark mode.

## üéõÔ∏è Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Click or tap on a cell to perform an action.

## üì± Cross-Platform Deployment

To package this web application as a native mobile app for Android and iOS, you can use a wrapper like [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

### Example with Capacitor

1. **Install Capacitor**:

    ```sh
    npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
    ```

2. **Initialize Capacitor**:

    ```sh
    npx cap init "Color War" "com.example.colorwar" --web-dir "public"
    ```

3. **Add Mobile Platforms**:

    ```sh
    npx cap add android
    npx cap add ios
    ```

4. **Sync and Build**:

    ```sh
    npx cap sync
    npx cap open android
    npx cap open ios
    ```

    This will open the native projects in Android Studio and Xcode, where you can build and run the app on emulators or physical devices.
